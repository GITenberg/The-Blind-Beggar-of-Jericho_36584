<h2>THE BLIND BEGGAR OF<br />
JERICHO.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>It is very common to see blind men
begging in the streets. Do not you pity
the blind? How sad it must be never to
see the light of the sun, nor the green
leaves in spring, nor the faces of our
dearest friends!</p>

<p>A long while ago a blind man sat
begging by the side of the road. As he
sat he heard the noise of a great crowd
walking along. He did not know why
there was such a crowd, so he asked the
people passing by why so many had
come together. They told him that
Jesus of Nazareth was passing that way.
The blind man had heard before of Jesus.
He had heard that he could do great
wonders, and he felt sure in his heart
that Jesus could make him see. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the blind man could not go to him&mdash;how
could he dare to stir in such a crowd?
He might have been pushed down and
trodden upon and crushed to death. But
he could speak. He cried out very loud,
"Have mercy on me, O Lord." He did
not cry out once or twice, he kept on
crying out, hoping that Jesus would hear
him. But the Lord took no notice of
him, and a great many people came up
to him and told him not to make such a
noise. Yet the poor man would not be
quiet; he knew that the Lord was passing
by, and that he might soon be gone,
and that he might never pass that way
again, so he cried out more than ever,
"Lord, have mercy on me!" And did
the Lord take notice of him at last?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Yes, he did; he stood still, and told the
people to bring that blind man to him.
How kind it was in Jesus to care for
the blind beggar! Jesus is very kind,
and cares for every poor creature in the
world. At last the blind man heard
some one speak kindly to him, and say,
"Be of good comfort; rise, he calleth
thee." How glad he was to hear that
Jesus had sent for him! He got up very
quickly, and went to Jesus, for now the
people made room for him. No one
now was rude to the poor beggar, for
Jesus had called for him.</p>

<p>And what did Jesus say to him? He
asked him this question, "What do you
wish me to do for you?" The man replied,
"Lord, that I may receive my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
sight." Jesus pitied him very much, and
he touched his eyes, and said, "Receive
thy sight." That moment he was able
to see. How glad he now was that he
had cried out, "Lord, have mercy on
me," and that he had not left off when
the people told him not to make a noise!
He would not leave Jesus now he had
found him, but went after him on the road,
praising him, and thanking God for his
goodness.</p>

<p>If all people would pray as this blind
man did, Jesus would hear them all.
The child who reads this book is not
blind. If you were blind how could you
read to father or to mother? But there
is something which Jesus could do for
you, that would make you happy for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
ever. What is it? Do you know? If
he were to say, "What do you wish me
to do for you?" what would you answer?
I should like you to say, "Forgive me
my sins, and give me thy Holy Spirit."
My dear child, do make this little prayer
every day. Jesus would hear you. Perhaps
you live in a very poor place.
Perhaps you live in a little room in town,
up some dark and narrow stairs; perhaps
there is very little furniture in it, and
very little food in the cupboard, but
Jesus knows where you live, and he
knows your name, and your father's
name, and your mother's name, and he
hears all you say. He would be much
pleased to hear you praying to him, because
he loves you, and he once died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
upon the cross that you might not go to
hell. If you go to heaven you will see
the blind beggar there&mdash;I mean the
beggar who once was blind. Then you
will sing with him about the love of
Jesus in saving your souls.</p>

<p>If you wish to read a full account of
this blind man, you will find it in Mark
x. 46 to end, and also in Luke xviii. 35
to end.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
